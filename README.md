# Speech Emotion Recognition Project

## Introduction

This project, developed at the Ukrainian Catholic University, focuses on the domain of Speech Emotion Recognition using Linear Algebra techniques. The main objective is to use and invesigate mathematical models and algorithms to identify emotions from speech patterns effectively.

## Repository Content
- `code.ipynb`: Notebook containing all the project's code.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models. Dataset is already divided into `Test` and `Train`.

## Project Highlights

- **Feature Extraction** 
Utilizes Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to capture essential characteristics of speech.
- **Data Reduction** 
Applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature dimensions.
- **Classification**
Uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to categorize emotions based on processed speech data.
- **Comparison and Analysis**
Performs comparison and analysis of results we got.
